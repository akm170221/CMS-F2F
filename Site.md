# CMS-F2F
Our project contains four pages to introduce and as a home page. 

We have  many categories for organic products starting from fruits, vegetable to shampoo, creams etc.

We also use the plugin called starter template. Its purpose is to control the pages. While making changes about the website such as information of the store, location, opening and closing time, you should use NicePage to edit and make changes.

New content can be added to the site using the standard WordPress process for adding content

Main pages of the site are added as Pages in WordPress.
Blog entries are added as Posts
Images and videos are added to the Media folder
