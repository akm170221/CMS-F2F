The theme contains a main theme, which is responsible for the style and functionality of the main interface. The code is in the style.css file and function.php file in the root directory. The style.css file is divided into 15 sections, some of which contain subitems that are responsible for styling different content on the main screen. The general table of contents is stated in the comments at the beginning of the code, and there are comments at the beginning of every section of the code, allowing developers to select the sections they want to change based on the comments.

This custom theme features uncluttered, intuitive site layout, complete with a navigation system that is straightforward and easy to understand.
