# CMS-F2F
Our team has created its own theme and website. This is a business that sells organic products. We built the website in order that our customers can get to know about our business models, products in more deatil, and can get it deliever to there place without coming to our shop.

The language used to create the theme is css and php. we made it locally and uploaded it to Wordpress, and then to the staging and production site, then added a lot of content to complete our site.
